## Test Completion

The following tests are implemented:
- **EmployeeController Tests**: The test suite for the `EmployeeController` is written and includes:
    - Checking if the controller is properly defined.
    - Validating the employee hierarchy returned by the `getHierarchy` method.

### Incomplete Tests
- **Edge Cases**: Tests to cover edge cases like invalid IDs or empty results were not fully implemented due to time constraints. However, the approach is to mock the `EmployeeService` for these cases, returning an empty list or an error.
- **Performance Tests**: The performance of the `getHierarchy` method, particularly for large datasets (e.g., 5000+ employees), should be tested under load to ensure scalability.
  
The above tests will be completed and executed once the basic functionality is validated.

## Next Steps:
- Implement additional edge case testing (e.g., invalid input, empty data).
- Set up performance tests to validate handling of larger datasets and concurrent requests.
